Hi, I'm Johann,

I'm a software engineer at the Allen Institute for AI in Seattle, where I work with the team 
that manages the core software and hardware infrastructure for machine-learning applications.
At some companies this might be called Machine-Learning Operations (MLOps).
Our work includes a in-house container orchestration engine, a platform for internal and external 
demos and other websites, and an inventory platform for maintaining and updating our machine 
learning servers.

Before my current team, I worked on several more research oriented software projects, developed 
domain-specific compilers and designed GPU algorithms for high-performance computing 
architectures for several scientific domains.

My dissertation work focused on improving several finite element methods for modeling systems 
of second-order partial differential equations, such as the Navier-Stokes equations of fluid 
dynamics.
